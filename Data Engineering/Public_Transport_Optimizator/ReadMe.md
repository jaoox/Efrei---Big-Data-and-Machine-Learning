# Paris Public Transportation Optimizer

## Storytelling

In an effort to enhance the experience of millions of commuters, the Parisian Transit Authority has collaborated with Efrei Paris to develop an innovative solution that leverages the power of IoT devices. By equipping the city’s public transport fleet with advanced sensors, we aim to collect pivotal data to optimize routes, improve scheduling, and enhance overall operational efficiency. The end goal is to cultivate a culture of punctuality, safety, and environmental responsibility, transforming Paris into a beacon of smart city innovation.

## Architecture

This project's architecture encapsulates the flow of data from IoT devices to actionable insights. Here’s an outline of the main components:

### Producers

- **IoT Devices on Vehicles**: These devices serve as the primary producers, emitting real-time geolocation data, passenger counts, and environmental metrics.
- **IoT Devices on Mobiles**: Utilize public transportation apps on users' mobile phones to emit geolocation data and destination information.

### Data Flow

- **Apache Kafka**: Serves as the nerve center of our data pipeline, ingesting and distributing streams to various consumers.

### Stream Processing

- **Apache Kafka Streams**: Employs real-time stream processing to handle urgent scenarios like vehicle diversions or emergency alerts.
- **Apache Flink**: Augments Kafka Streams, focusing on time-critical computations and immediate notifications to passengers and staff.

### Storage

- **MongoDB**: A versatile NoSQL database configured for real-time data operations, catering to the demands of high-velocity IoT outputs.
- **Hadoop HDFS**: Provides a robust distributed file system that facilitates the storage of vast quantities of data for historical analytics.

### Consumers

- **Real-Time Alert Service**: A dedicated module that consumes streams to identify and act upon urgent events or anomalies.
- **Long-Term Analytics Service**: Utilizes Spark for batch processing, feeding into machine learning models and analytics dashboards.

### Analytics and Machine Learning

- **Spark NLP**: Spark-based Natural Language Processing to delve into passenger feedback and social media for sentiment analysis and trend spotting.

### Dashboards

- **Data Visualization**: Integration with tools like Grafana or Tableau to provide insightful dashboards for transit authorities, enabling data-driven decisions.
